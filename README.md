This will hopefully be used for stocks

Current TODO:
  - Identify why 46731 does not work with 1 Layer(4,1,0) but 1Depth does
  - Fix it
  - Verify that it works on the basic 1s and 0s dataset
  - Add an activation function (sigmoid, swish, etc)
  - Add a more advance error calculation/update weights system
  - Verify that it works on the basic 1s and 0s dataset
  - Get stock data from past years:
  -   - Pre-covid and during covid
  - Verify that the model works on that stock data
  - Tweak it to make it best as possible
  - MAKE MONEY!!
